The Couchbase Power BI Connector integrates:

* Couchbase Analytics tabular views.
+
TIP: For self-managed CBAS, the Power BI connector requires Couchbase Server 7.2.4 or newer.
* Capella Columnar instances
+
TIP: Capella columnar is currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview].

* or Capella provisioned services

with Microsoft's Power BI interactive data visualization platform.

== Prerequisites

You can integrate the Power BI platform with Couchbase Capella, or an instance of the self-managed Couchbase Server.
You should also run the xref:server:analytics:1_intro.adoc[Couchbase Analytics service] on the target node.

== Install Power BI

Before you start, ensure  you have a supported version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed.
The Couchbase Power BI Connector requires Power BI Desktop version March 2017 or later. 

If necessary, download Power BI Desktop from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=58494[Microsoft downloads] page. 

NOTE: Power BI is only available for the Microsoft Windows platform;
for other platforms, consider our xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[Tableau connector].

== Install the Couchbase ODBC Driver

. Download the `couchbase-odbc-1.1-win64.msi` file from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.1/couchbase-odbc-1.1-win64.msi[] -- see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Double-click the file to open the *Couchbase ODBC Setup Wizard*.

. Install the ODBC drivers from the downloaded file.
This installation provides both ANSI and Unicode drivers.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have installed the 64-bit versions of the ODBC drivers.

== Install OpenSSL

The connection between a Couchbase Analytics instance or a Capella columnar database (currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview])
and Power BI requires a Couchbase ODBC driver.
OpenSSL is a required dependency for the driver.


. Download `Win64 OpenSSL v3.3.1 Light` from the https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[Shining Light Productions site].

. Install OpenSSL from the downloaded file.

. Verify that Windows has installed SSL, and registered the path of the binary.
Open the command prompt (`cmd`), and enter the following:
+
[source, console]
----
openssl version
----

. If the output indicates OpenSSL is not installed, rather than returning the version that you installed, then you need to add the OpenSSL binary's path to the `env`:

.. Check the `C:\Program Files` or use `Find` to locate the SSL binary -- usually the path will be something like:
+
[source, console]
----
C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
----

.. Add this path to the environmental variables list, found in menu:System variables[Path].

.. Now verify that Windows has registered the path of the binary.
Once again, open the command prompt (`cmd`) -- it must be a fresh command prompt, as the earlier one will not have loaded the newly added environmental variables -- and enter the following:
+
[source, console]
----
openssl version
----

== Setting up a Secure Connection

Couchbase *strongly* recommends that you secure your ODBC connection using SSL.
This ensures encryption of the communication between Power BI and the Couchbase server/Capella.

====
Couchbase Capella::
+
--
You will need to obtain a connection string for your database,
and generate an API key to plug into the ODBC connector.

[#copy-connection-string]#To obtain the `connection string`.#

. Sign in to your Capella instance as an Administrator.
. Select the menu:Connect[] item from the top-level menu.
. Make a copy of the `public connection string`.
+

image::create-database-access.png[Creating database access]

. To set up a secure connection, you will need to retrieve the root certificate for your Capella instance.
+
[lowerroman]
.. Click on btn:[Security Certificate] in the left menu.
.. Click on btn:[Download] to transfer a copy of the root certificate to your local machine.
+

Self-Managed Couchbase Server::
+
--

[#download-root-certificate]#To create a secure connection to a self-managed Couchbase Server instance, you need to get the root certificate from the Administrator's Console.#

. Use your web browser to access the Admin console and log in as an Administrator.
. Use the left-hand menu to access the menu:Security[] settings.
. From the top menu, select menu:Certificates[]. This will take you to the page from which you can view the server's security certificates:
+
image::access-root-certificate.png[]
+
. Copy *all* the text in the Trusted *Root Certificates* section (start from `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and include `END CERTIFICATE` ), and save the text to an accessible `PEM` file. (e.g., `C:\Users\user\certificate.pem`).
+
You will use this file later when you create the ODBC connection.

== Configure the ODBC Data Source

You need to configure the data source parameters to connect your Power BI desktop to Couchbase.

To configure the Couchbase ODBC driver as a *User DSN:*

. Open the ODBC Administration tool.
. Create a new ODBC connection using one of the Couchbase drivers (either `ANSI` or `Unicode`), then select btn:[Finish]
. On the next window, select btn:[Couchbase Analytics].
. Depending on whether you are connecting to Couchbase Capella or a self-managed Couchbase Server instance, fill in the parameters from the choices below:
+
[tabs]
====

Couchbase Capella::
+
--
[horizontal]
*Name:*:: Enter an identifying name for the data source.

*Description:*:: Enter an optional description.

*Host:*:: Fill in the connection string you copied <<copy-connection-string,here>>.
+
include::partial$common.adoc[tag="remove-prefix-warning"]

*Port:*:: Use `11207` for a secure connection.

*Scope*:: Name of the scope from which the data is being extracted.
If a two-part scope -- such as `travel-sample.inventory` -- then the two parts must be separated by a `/` -- `travel-sample/inventory`.

== Install the Couchbase Power BI Connector
You will need to install the connector that allows Power BI to communicate with Couchbase, using ODBC.

. Download `couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez` from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-powerbi-connector/1.0/couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez[] --
see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Follow https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connector-extensibility#custom-connectors[Microsoft's guide] on configuring a custom connector.


=== Verify the Connector is Loaded Successfully:

. Open *Power BI*.

. Go to *Get Data -> More -> Couchbase Connector*


The Couchbase Power BI Connector is now correctly configured to work with the Power BI platform.

Next, you configure a connection to Couchbase Analytics or an instance of the Capella columnar database.


== Configure an ODBC Data Source

You configure a data source name (DSN) for each CBAS scope or Capella columnar database you want to use in Power BI. 



=== Configure a User DSN in Power BI

You can install either *Couchbase ODBC Driver (ANSI)* or *Couchbase Unicode Driver (UNICODE)*. 
If the data contains multibyte characters, select Unicode.

[IMPORTANT]
Be careful to use the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64 bit)*; there is an *ODBC Data Source Administrator (32 bit)*
available, but this will not work with the connector.

When the *Create data source for Couchbase* dialog opens,
select *Capella Columnar* or (for CBAS) *Couchbase Analytics* and enter values as follows: 


== Use the Couchbase Power BI Connector

Business information tools rely on data that is organized into relational databases. 
To use the Power BI connector, you must create tabular analytics views of your JSON documents. 
// For Capella columnar, see xref:query:workbench.adoc#TAV[Save Results as a Tabular View] or xref:sqlpp:5_ddl.adoc#TAV[Tabular Views].
For self-managed CBAS, see xref:server:analytics:run-query.adoc#Using_analytics_workbench[the workbench docs] or 
xref:server:analytics:5a_views.adoc[tabular views].

After you prepare tabular views and define DSNs in Power BI, you use the Couchbase Power BI Connector to load data into Power BI. 

=== Use the Connector to Add Data to Power BI

To add data from Capella columnar or CBAS to Power BI, follow the instructions to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-data[Connect to data sources in Power BI desktop] in the Microsoft documentation.

*Couchbase Connector* appears on the menu:Get Data[] list of data sources. 
When prompted for *Username* and *Password*, supply your Capella columnar or CBAS credentials. 

After you connect, a list of the tabular views in the database specified by the DSN appears. 
btn:[Load] a view to use Power BI options.

An example image of the `travel-sample` `airport_view` follows.
