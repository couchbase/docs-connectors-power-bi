TIP: For self-managed CBAS, the Power BI connector requires Couchbase Server 7.2.4 or newer.
* Capella Columnar instances

* or Capella provisioned services

With Microsoft's Power BI interactive data visualization platform.
--

== Prerequisites

You can integrate the Power BI platform with Couchbase Capella or an instance of the self-managed Couchbase Server.
You should also run the xref:server:analytics:1_intro.adoc[Couchbase Analytics service] on the target node.

== Install Power BI

Before you start, ensure  you have a supported version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed.
The Couchbase Power BI Connector requires Power BI Desktop version March 2017 or later. 

If necessary, download Power BI Desktop from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=58494[Microsoft downloads] page. 

NOTE: Power BI is only available for the Microsoft Windows platform;
for other platforms, consider our xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[Tableau connector].

== Install the Couchbase ODBC Driver

. Download the `couchbase-odbc-1.1-win64.msi` file from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.1/couchbase-odbc-1.1-win64.msi[] -- see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Double-click the file to open the *Couchbase ODBC Setup Wizard*.

. Install the ODBC drivers from the downloaded file.
This installation provides both ANSI and Unicode drivers.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have installed the 64-bit versions of the ODBC drivers.

== Install OpenSSL

The connection between a Couchbase Analytics instance or a Capella columnar database and Power BI requires a Couchbase ODBC driver.
OpenSSL is a required dependency for the driver.


. Download `Win64 OpenSSL v3.3.1 Light` from the https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[Shining Light Productions site].

. Install OpenSSL from the downloaded file.

. Verify that Windows has installed SSL and registered the path of the binary.
Open the command prompt (`cmd`), and enter the following:
+
[source, console]
----
openssl version
----

. If the output indicates OpenSSL is not installed, rather than returning the version that you installed, then you need to add the OpenSSL binary's location to the `PATH` environment:

.. Check the `C:\Program Files` or use `Find` to locate the SSL binary -- usually the path will be something like:
+
[source, console]
----
C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
----

.. Add this path to the environmental variables list, found in menu:System variables[Path].

.. Now verify that Windows has registered the path of the binary.
Once again, open the command prompt (`cmd`) -- it must be a fresh command prompt, as the earlier one will not have loaded the newly added environmental variables -- and enter the following:
+
[source, console]
----
openssl version
----


== Install the Couchbase Power BI Connector
You will need to install the connector that allows Power BI to communicate with Couchbase, through ODBC.

. Download `couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez` from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-powerbi-connector/1.0/couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez[] --
see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Follow https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connector-extensibility#custom-connectors[Microsoft's guide] on configuring a custom connector.


== Verify the Connector is Loaded Successfully:

. Open *Power BI*.

. Go to menu:Get Data from Other Sources[Get data from another source].

. Use the search box to find btn:[Couchbase Connector].


== Setting up a Secure Connection

Couchbase *strongly* recommends that you secure your ODBC connection using SSL.
This ensures encryption of the communication between Power BI and the Couchbase server/Capella.


[tabs]
====
Capella Operational::
+
--
You will need to get a connection string for your database
and generate an API key to plug into the ODBC connector.

[#copy-connection-string]#To obtain the `connection string`.#

. Sign in to your Capella instance as an Administrator.
. Select the menu:Connect[] item from the top-level menu.
. Make a copy of the `public connection string`.
+

Capella Columnar::
+
--

For details on creating a Capella Columnar instance,
first see xref:columnar:admin:prepare-project.adoc[Creating a Capella Columnar Cluster].

[#capella-columnar-connection-string]#You will need to access the Capella administration console to get the connection string for your columnar database.#

. Sign in to your Capella instance as an `Organization owner` or `Project owner`.
. Select menu:Columnar[] from the top-level page menu.
. Select your Columnar cluster from the list.
. Select menu:Settings[] from the top-level page menu.
+
image::select-columnar-cluster-settings.png[]
+
. Select menu:Connection String[] from the left-hand menu.
+
image::get-capella-columnar-connection-string.png[]
+
. Make a note of the connection string.

Next, you need to add the IP address of the machine from which you are running Power BI,
 so that Capella will allow the machine to access the columnar data.

. Click on menu:Allowed IP Addresses[] in the left-hand menu.
. Click the btn:[Add Allowed IP] button.

+
image::capella-columnar-add-allowed-ip.png[]
+
. Enter the IP address of the Power BI host machine.
+
TIP: You can use the btn:[Add Current IP Address] button to fill in the address of the machine currently running the web console.

[#capella-columnar-user-account]#Now, you will need to create a user account for Power BI to access the columnar data.#

. Return to the menu:Settings[] page, then click on menu:Access Control[] in the left-hand menu.
. Click on btn:[Create Account].
. Add a `username` and `password` for the new account.
. Make sure you set assign  `sys_view_reader` to the list of roles.
+
image::capella-columnar-user-account.png[]
+
. Click btn:[Create Account] to finish setting up the user account.
--

Self-Managed Couchbase Server::
+
--

[#download-root-certificate]#To create a secure connection to a self-managed Couchbase Server instance, you need to get the root certificate from the Administrator's Console.#

. Use your web browser to access the Admin console and log in as an Administrator.
. Use the left-hand menu to access the menu:Security[] settings.
. From the top menu, select menu:Certificates[]. This will take you to the page from which you can view the server's security certificates:
+
image::access-root-certificate.png[]
+
. Copy *all* the text in the Trusted *Root Certificates* section (start from `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and include `END CERTIFICATE` ),
and save the text to an accessible `PEM` file.
E.g., `C:\Users\user\certificate.pem`).
+
You will use this file later when you create the ODBC connection.
--

====

== Configure an ODBC Data Source

You configure an ODBC data source name (DSN) for each CBAS scope or Capella columnar database you want to use in Power BI.
[IMPORTANT]
 Be careful to use the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64 bit)*; there is an *ODBC Data Source Administrator (32 bit)*
 available, but this will not work with the connector.

== Use the Couchbase Power BI Connector

Business information tools rely on data organized into relational databases.
To use the Power BI connector, you must create tabular analytics views of your JSON documents. 
// For Capella columnar, see xref:query:workbench.adoc#TAV[Save Results as a Tabular View] or xref:sqlpp:5_ddl.adoc#TAV[Tabular Views].
For self-managed CBAS, see xref:server:analytics:run-query.adoc#Using_analytics_workbench[the workbench docs] or 
xref:server:analytics:5a_views.adoc[tabular views].

After you prepare tabular views and define DSNs in Power BI, you use the Couchbase Power BI Connector to load data into Power BI. 

=== Use the Connector to Add Data to Power BI

To add data from Capella columnar or CBAS to Power BI, follow the instructions to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-data[Connect to data sources in Power BI desktop] in the Microsoft documentation.

*Couchbase Connector* appears on the menu:Get Data[] list of data sources. 
When prompted for *Username* and *Password*,
supply the account username and password you created for <<setup-database-access,Capella Operational>> or
<<capella-columnar-user-account,Capella Columnar>>.
If you are running a Self-Managed Couchbase Server, then supply a set of credentials with the correct data access permissions.

NOTE: The user account credentials for Capella Operational or Capella Columnar will always match the username and password attached to the ODBC DSN.

After you connect, a list of the tabular views in the database specified by the DSN appears. 
btn:[Load] a view to use Power BI options.

An example image of the `travel-sample` `airport_view` follows.
